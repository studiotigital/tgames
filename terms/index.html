Terms of Service
BY USING AND/OR VISITING THIS WEBSITE (collectively, including all Content available through the GAMEFREE domain name, the "GAMEFREE Website", or "Website"), YOU SIGNIFY YOUR ASSENT TO TERMS OF USE, WHICH ARE PUBLISHED AT http://GAMEFREE/terms.htm AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the GAMEFREE Website.
2. GAMEFREE Website
These Terms of Use apply to all users of the GAMEFREE Website, including users who are also contributors of manga content, information, and other materials or services on the Website. The GAMEFREE Website may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by GAMEFREE. GAMEFREE has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, GAMEFREE will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Website, you expressly relieve GAMEFREE from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the GAMEFREE Website and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.
3. Website Access
A. GAMEFREE hereby grants you permission to use the Website as set forth in this Terms of Use, provided that: (i) your use of the Website as permitted is solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not copy or distribute any part of the Website in any medium without GAMEFREE's prior written authorization; (iii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Website other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Website for its intended purpose; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.

B. In order to access some features of the Website, you will have to create an account. You may never use another's account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. You must notify GAMEFREE immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although GAMEFREE will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of GAMEFREE or others due to such unauthorized use.

C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the GAMEFREE servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a convention on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, GAMEFREE grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. GAMEFREE reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.

5. User Submissions
A. The GAMEFREE Website may now or in the future permit the submission of manga or other communications submitted by you and other users ("User Submissions") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such User Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published, GAMEFREE does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions.

B. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. In connection with User Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize GAMEFREE to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Use; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Use. For clarity, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions. However, by submitting the User Submissions to GAMEFREE, you hereby grant GAMEFREE a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the GAMEFREE Website and GAMEFREE's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the GAMEFREE Website (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each user of the GAMEFREE Website a non-exclusive license to access your User Submissions through the Website, and to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Website and under these Terms of Use. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a User Submission from the GAMEFREE Website.

C. In connection with User Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant GAMEFREE all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage GAMEFREE or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business: (v) impersonate another person. GAMEFREE does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and GAMEFREE expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions.

GAMEFREE reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice. GAMEFREE will also terminate a User's access to its Website, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had a User Submission removed from the Website more than twice. GAMEFREE also reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to, pornography, obscene or defamatory material, or excessive length. GAMEFREE may remove such User Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Use at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

D. In particular, if you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe that any User Submission or other content infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit a notification pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") by providing our Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail):

(i) A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;

(ii) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;

(iii) Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material;

(iv) Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail;

(v) A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

(vi) A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

GAMEFREE's designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed infringement is: copyright@GAMEFREE.me. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go to the Copyright Agent; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed to GAMEFREE customer service.
